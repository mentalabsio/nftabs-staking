# Magicshards Staking Program
- [x] Should be able to whitelist a collection. Each collection has its own reward rate. (tokens/gem/sec).
- [x] Should be able to stake an NFT from a whitelisted collection.
- [x] The reward should be calculated based on the lock factor/duration.


### TODO:
- [x] Allow whitelisting a mint address (for fungible tokens).
- [x] Allow staking fungible tokens.
- [x] Remove mint/creator from whitelist.

### NFTabs staking rules
- [x] Stake a pair [NFT A, NFT B] (technically can be done, but there's no program logic for the "pair" thing)
- [x] Buff a staked pair with NFT C. 
- [x] Stake $TOKENS with lock.
